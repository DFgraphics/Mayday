The layered versions of the PNG have the background not flattened into the creature graphics.

The transparent versions of the PNG files have no background at all.
To create a Mayday-style background for a transparent version, it needs to be this color:
RGB Decimal: R: 87, G: 71, B:57    (aka Hex #574739)
The background's opacity should be set to 50%.
